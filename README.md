"# coursesEAD" 

"I not published the whole project, but with this project you can add courses, add questions by area. The online test take 30 random questions from the database. You have 2 hours to complete the test. The test say to you if you got it right or wrong and gives to you an explanation for every question. You can enroll courses. The dashboard is just for admins. The students can't see the dashboard. I did by myself everything. The language is C# with asp.net core 2.0 with MySql. But you can use with SQL Server. There's two templates. One for homepage and one for login. You can change the templates easily."
